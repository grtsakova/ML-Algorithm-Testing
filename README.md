# Machine Learning Algorithm Testing

This project consists of Jupyter notebooks testing different machine learning algorithms for both classification and regression tasks. The project is part of a course conducted at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC) during the academic year 2022-2023.

## Notebooks

The project includes the following notebooks:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Classification and Regression Trees (CART)**
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
4. **Neural Networks (NN)**

## Datasets

- **Classification**: Blood Transfusion Service Center dataset
- **Regression**: Energy efficiency for buildings dataset
